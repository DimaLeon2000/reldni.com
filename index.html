Welcome to the Reldni Productions Restoration Project, which aims to preserve the entertainment created by Reldni for the future. We consist of Reldni fans who wish to preserve Reldni's creations for future generations using detective work and digital archeology, but are not related to Reldni Productions or their past employees.

<p>This website is still under construction, but we have some nifty things here.</p>

<h3>What is Reldni Productions?</h3>

<p>
Reldni was a company that produced unusual entertainment from 1985 to 2000, when it suddenly ceased operations under mysterious circumstances. Reldni was perhaps most famous for its <em>Vinnie's Tomb</em> series of computer games, but they also produced many other games, as well as several music albums, fiction, and other media. Troy Scott was the company's CEO.
